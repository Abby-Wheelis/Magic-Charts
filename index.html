<h1>Sweet, Sweet Animations </h1>

<p>
The charts that we saw in class yesterday were made using the animation and transition techniques that are a part of d3. The d3 methods of .transition(), . duration(), .ease(), and .delay() come together to create beautiful transitions between the different views of test scores that are timed down to the millisecond. In this case, the data remained the same, but it could be updated by modifying the dataset, rebinding the new values to the existing elements, and adding new attributes. These changes are called when triggered by a bound function that is “listening” for the appropriate command. This is often seen as .on(“click”, function(d) {//do things}); but can also be done for “mouseover” and “mouseout.” In addition to updating the dataset or transitioning the graph, a .on(“click”,...) is useful to also sort the data in a new way using the .sort() method. These d3 methods made the seemingly magical visualizations seem more reasonably achieved and less like witchcraft. A final noteworthy piece of d3 visualization are tooltips, which are created with default browser methods, svg elements, or a div directly created in the DOM. This final method is most useful when the creator of the visualization wants to create effects in CSS, such as drop-shadows.
